# AutoencoderforImageCompression
This reposotory consists of implementaion of a convolutional Autoencoder to achieve Image Compression with a total of 6 convolutional2D layer anded with 3 MaxPooling and 3 UpSampling layers which are equally divided among the encoder and decoder parts.

# Dataset Used
The dataset used in the project is a collection of around 27500 microscopic images of blood cells of normal and malaria infected patients.The dataset is available on kaggle.
There has been a growing interest in building an efficient automated malaria diagnostic system to deliver resources remotely to those underdeveloped areas where malaria has a marked predominance.The project aims at developing an autoencoder which could diagonose malaria infected blood cells.
